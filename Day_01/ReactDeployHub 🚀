This repository provides a step-by-step guide for deploying both static and dynamic React pages using Docker and Kubernetes.

### **1. Deploying a Static Page in Docker:**
- **Build** a Docker image for the React static page.
- **Deploy** the Docker container to any environment.
- **Run** the container to serve the static content.

### **2. Deploying the Static Page on Kubernetes Using Docker Images:**
- **Push** the Docker image to a container registry.
- **Create** a Kubernetes deployment from the Docker image.
- **Expose** the static page using Kubernetes Services.

---

### **3. Deploying a Dynamic Page with Docker:**
- **Build** Docker images for the React app with dynamic content (including API/backend services).
- **Set up** a 3-tier architecture (Frontend, Backend, Database) with Docker containers.
- **Run** the containers for real-time data fetching and user interaction.

### **4. Deploying the Dynamic Page on Kubernetes Using Docker Images:**
- **Push** the Docker images of the frontend, backend, and database to a container registry.
- **Create** Kubernetes deployments for each tier of the dynamic app.
- **Link** the containers with Kubernetes Services and expose the dynamic page.

This project serves as a comprehensive guide for deploying both static and dynamic React applications, utilizing Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.
